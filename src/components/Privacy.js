Collecting Personal Information

When you visit any of our Sites, we collect certain information about your device, your interaction with the Sites, and information necessary to process your purchases or registrations. We may also collect additional information if you contact us for customer support, create an online account, register your product, or sign up for a mailing list. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to any information that can uniquely identify an individual (including the information below) as “Personal Information”. See the list below for more information about what Personal Information we collect and why.

The information we ask for when you order on our Sites is your name, address, phone number, credit card number, and email address, etc. This information is used only to complete the order, to confirm the order, and to confirm shipment of the order. You may, upon placement of an order, opt to allow SPACE® to save the information for a faster checkout process the next time by creating an online account. This information is then stored only for the purposes of faster checkout and is not used for any other purpose.

The information obtained from our Sites is utilized only to keep a record of your pertinent information and to assist you and create a better user experience. This information is not available to the public, is stored securely, and only granted to authorized SPACE® personnel and accessed when necessary to assist you. This information is shared with our processor Shopify, Facebook, and Google, payment gateways, shipping and fulfillment apps, sales channels, outsourced customer services agencies, etc.

Your Personal Information is Secure

SPACE® will never utilize your personal information in any way and never shares or sells your e-mail address or other personal information to anyone.

Some smartphone operating systems may require permission to access your location, but this is only necessary for the function of the app and no personal information is collected from you.

SPACE takes necessary precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way, including but not limited to Paypal, Amazon pay, etc. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the web page.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only authorized SPACE® personnel who need the information to perform a specific task are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers and servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

SPACE will use third parties and only share personal information with them as necessary to conduct standard business practices, such as completing sales transactions, communicating with financial institutions, providing shipping information to carriers for the purpose of delivering orders, etc.
